1. THE NODE WAY
    - Small Core:
        * The core set of functionalities is set to the bare minimum, leaving the rest to userland. This is good
            for maintainability and evolution.
    - Small Modules:
        * Make each program do one thing well.
        * Small is beautiful
        * DRY - Dont Repeat Yourself
        * Extreme levels of reusability
        * Code easier to understaind and use
        * Code easier to test and maintain
        * Perfect for the browser
    - Small Surface Area:
        * Usually expose only one functionality, do not expose internals.
        * Single, unmistakably entry point.
        * Packages created to be used, not extended. (Reduces use cases, simplifies implementations)
    - Simplicity and Pragmatism
        * Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)
        * Simplicity is the most important consideration in a design
        * Less effort, ships faster, easier to maintain and understaind

1.1 HOW NODE WORKS
    - I/O is slow
    - There exists blocking and non blockin I/O

2. THE REACTOR PATTERN
3. JS ON THE SERVER
